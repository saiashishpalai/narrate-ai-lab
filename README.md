üöÄ Overview
Voice Cloning Studio lets users upload a sample of their voice and instantly convert story text (or a PDF!) to audio that sounds just like them.

Built as a full-stack MVP, it integrates a React (Lovable) frontend, n8n as the backend orchestrator, Supabase for file and database storage, 11Labs for neural TTS, and third-party PDF extraction.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Frontend: React (Lovable)
Backend Automation: n8n (workflow orchestrator)
Voice/Audio Storage: Supabase (storage + DB)
Text-to-Speech: 11Labs API
PDF Extraction: PDF.co/Nanonets (or custom)
Authentication: Supabase Auth (can integrate with OAuth)

‚öôÔ∏è Architecture
User uploads a voice sample & enters or uploads story text/PDF via the Lovable UI.
Frontend sends files/text to n8n via a secured Webhook or API endpoint.
n8n workflow:
- Uploads files to Supabase.
- Extracts text from PDFs (if needed).
- Calls 11Labs API with text + voice reference.
- Stores generated audio in Supabase storage.
- Records transaction metadata in Supabase DB.
- Frontend gets real-time feedback, allowing the user to listen or download the audio.

üéØ Usage
Go to the app and upload your sample voice (MP3/WAV/M4A).
Paste or upload your story (text or PDF).
